# Lyrenne (Windows)

A desktop port of the Lyrenne YouTube Music client using Compose Multiplatform.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java 21+** - Download from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
2. **VLC Media Player (64-bit)** - Required for audio playback. Download from [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

## Building

From the project root directory:

```bash
# Run the desktop app
./gradlew :desktop:run

# Build a distributable (MSI/EXE for Windows)
./gradlew :desktop:packageMsi
./gradlew :desktop:packageExe

# Create a distribution folder
./gradlew :desktop:createDistributable
```

## Architecture

The desktop app reuses the following modules from the Android app:
- `:innertube` - YouTube Music API client
- `:kugou` - Lyrics provider
- `:lrclib` - Lyrics database
- `:betterlyrics` - Time-synced lyrics
- `:simpmusic` - Additional lyrics API

Audio playback uses [VLCJ](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) instead of ExoPlayer.

## Troubleshooting

### "VLC not found"
Make sure you have VLC 64-bit installed. The app uses native discovery to find VLC.

### "Could not load audio stream"
Some videos may be region-restricted or require authentication. Try a different song.

### Build fails
Ensure you have Java 21+ installed and JAVA_HOME is set correctly.
